**Purpose:** High-level blueprint for landing page design and content

---

## 1. Overview & Objective

### What is jaanch.ai?
An AI-powered legal document verification platform that helps lawyers analyze complex case files. It reads hundreds of documents, finds contradictions, verifies citations, builds timelines, and surfaces patterns — all with evidence tied to exact page and line numbers.

### Landing Page Goal
Create a universally understandable page that:
- Explains what jaanch.ai does to anyone (lawyer or not)
- Emotionally connects with junior lawyers (the primary users)
- Shows business value to law firm decision-makers
- Differentiates from manual review AND generic AI tools like ChatGPT
- Drives visitors to take action (demo, signup, contact)

### Core Message
**"Lawyers miss what matters. We don't."**

### Brand Tagline
**"Verify, don't trust."**

### Hook Line
**"Miss one detail, lose the case."**

---

## 2. Target Audience

### Primary User: Junior Lawyers
- Overwhelmed by 700+ page case files
- Working late nights, scared of missing something critical
- Need a tool that catches what they might miss
- Will emotionally connect with the pain points

### Secondary Beneficiaries:
- **Senior Lawyers/Partners** — Need to validate junior's work quickly, want confidence nothing was overlooked
- **Law Firms** — Want competitive edge, worried about malpractice risk, care about efficiency and better outcomes

### Messaging Approach
Lead with junior lawyer's pain, then show the ripple effect to the whole firm.

## 3. Page Sections & Content

### Section 1: Hero

**Headline:**
> Lawyers miss what matters. We don't.

**Tagline:**
> Verify, don't trust.

**Subhead:**
> Miss one detail, lose the case. jaanch.ai reads every page of your case files and finds what humans miss — contradictions, misquoted laws, timeline gaps, missing documents. Every finding cited to the exact page and line.

**CTA Button:**
> See what you're missing

---

### Section 2: The Problem (Story Hook)

**Header:**
> 700 pages. 25 years of documents. Contradictions hiding in plain sight.

**Content:**
> In a Special Court matter, shares worth crores were disputed between two families. The case file ran to 700+ pages spanning 25 years of documents — affidavits, company letters, custodian correspondence, court orders.
>
> Buried in those pages: contradictory ownership claims, a meeting that violated court provisions, shares transferred without proper notification, and a pattern of disputed holdings that nobody connected across documents.
>
> Multiple sophisticated parties — the Company, the Custodian, legal teams on all sides — reviewed these files. The contradictions were there. The gaps were there. Nobody caught them all.

**Closing line:**
> That's the gap jaanch.ai fills.

---

### Section 3: What jaanch Finds (Concrete Examples)

**Header:**
> What jaanch catches that humans miss

**Four finding types with examples:**

| Finding | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Misquoted Laws** | "The petition says Section 65B allows X. The actual Act says Y." — Side-by-side comparison, instantly. |
| **Contradictions** | "The witness said one thing on page 234. On page 1,847, he said the opposite." — Caught across 2000 pages. |
| **Timeline Problems** | "This document was supposedly signed two days before it existed." — Impossible dates, flagged automatically. |
| **Entity Tracking** | "Sharma" = "R.K. Sharma" = "Mr. Sharma" = "the respondent" — All linked automatically, no matter how they appear. |

**Closing line:**
> Every finding links to the source document and page. If jaanch can't trace it back, it doesn't show it.

---

### Section 4: How It Works

**Header:**
> Three steps. Every finding cited.

**Step 1: Upload your case files**
> Drop your PDFs — even messy scans, ZIPs with hundreds of documents. Our AI reads everything.

**Step 2: AI analyzes everything**
> jaanch runs 4 specialized engines in parallel:
> - **Timeline** — Extracts dates, builds chronology, detects gaps
> - **Entities** — Maps people, companies, relationships
> - **Citations** — Finds every Act reference
> - **Contradictions** — Spots conflicting statements across documents

**Step 3: Review cited findings**
> Every finding is tied to the exact document, page, and line. Nothing vague — you verify, you decide.

---

### Section 5: ChatGPT vs jaanch

**Header:**
> ChatGPT summarizes. jaanch verifies.

**Comparison Table:**

| Ask ChatGPT | Ask jaanch |
|-------------|------------|
| "Summarize this case file" | "Find contradictions across these 700 pages" |
| Generic summary, no citations | Every finding cited to exact page & line |
| "The parties dispute ownership..." | "Party A claims X on Page 45, but states Y on Page 312" |
| Hallucinations possible | Evidence-bound — if it's not in the docs, we don't say it |
| No verification against Acts | Verifies citations against actual legal statutes |
| Confident even when wrong | Says "I don't know" when unsure |
| You hope it's right | You verify it's right |

**Trust Statement:**
> ### When jaanch doesn't know, it says so.
>
> Most AI tools give confident wrong answers. That's worse than no answer at all.
>
> jaanch flags what it's unsure about. Every finding is traced back to the source document and page. If it can't trace it back, it doesn't show it.
>
> *"Sometimes 'I don't know' is better than a wrong answer with high confidence."*

### Section 6: Built for Indian Legal Documents

**Header:**
> Built for the documents other tools can't handle

**Content:**
> - Scanned PDFs with poor image quality
> - Handwritten notes mixed with typed text
> - Three languages on the same page (English, Hindi, regional)
> - Old documents with faded text and stamps
>
> Most tools fail on this. jaanch was built for it.

---

### Section 7: Who It's For

**Header:**
> Built for the lawyer buried in documents

**Content:**
> You're staring at 700 pages. Somewhere in there is the contradiction that wins the case — or the gap that loses it. You have 48 hours.
>
> jaanch reads everything. Finds the patterns. Cites every finding to the exact page and line.
>
> **You verify. You strategize. You win.**

**Ripple effect:**
> - **Junior Lawyers** — Stop drowning in documents. Find what matters in hours, not days.
> - **Senior Lawyers** — Validate your team's research in minutes. Trust the findings because every one is cited.
> - **Law Firms** — Better case outcomes. Reduced risk. A team that works smarter.

---

### Section 8: Built By

**Header:**
> Built by lawyers, for lawyers

**Content:**
> jaanch.ai was built by Juhi Nebhnani and Siddhi Maheshwari as part of the 100xEngineers program.
>
> We've seen firsthand how critical details get missed in complex litigation. We built jaanch to solve that.

---

### Section 9: CTA (Closing)

**Header:**
> What if you could walk into court knowing you've found every gap in the other side's story?

**Subhead:**
> That's jaanch.ai. Verify, don't trust.

**CTA Button:**
> See what you're missing

**Secondary CTA (optional):**
> Book a demo for your firm
